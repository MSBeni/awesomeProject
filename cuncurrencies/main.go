//In Go, each concurrently executing activity is called a goroutine. Consider a program that has
//two functions, one that does some computation and one that writes some output, and assume
//that neither function calls the other. A sequential program may call one function and then call the other, but in a
// concurrent program with two or more goroutines, calls to both functions can be active at the same time. goroutine is
// similar to a thread
// If goroutines are the activities of a con cur rent Go program, channels are the connections between them. A channel
// is a communication mechanism that lets one goroutine send values to another goroutine. Each channel is a conduit for
// values of a particular type, called the channelâ€™s element type.
